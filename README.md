<h1>Events Administration</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In order to study an alternative to Redux for managing global states, Kenzie.Drinks was developed. This web application has the functionality of serving as a beverage list manager for different events, where the user can select a certain beverage and indicate to the list which event it should be added. Behind the scenes, the Context API organizes, collects and alters data, and puts the necessary data into the right components.</p>
